### Challenge Statement
Using Python and Flask, create a web-based workout generator application with a specialized focus on bodyweight exercises. The application should enable users to generate and customize personalized workout routines based on user input goals and constraints. The primary objective is to provide users with an intuitive platform to achieve their fitness goals using exercises that rely on natural resistance without the need for additional equipment.

### Product Vision
**FOR** individuals interested in improving their health and wellness, particularly those **WHO** may have limited exercise experience. The InfiniFit system is a web-based service **THAT** provides personalized bodyweight and calisthenics routines, recommending and incorporating easy-to-learn movements to improve users' overall health and fitness. **UNLIKE** other market offerings, **OUR PRODUCT** delivers an enjoyable and intuitive user experience, ensuring anyone can embark on their fitness journey with ease.

### Solution Description
- **User Profile**
  - Users set up their profiles, including fitness goals and constraints (time, fitness level, etc)
- **Exercise Database**
  - Build a database of bodyweight exercises, including variations for different skill levels. Each exercise should have tags (difficulty, muscle group, etc.).
- **Workout Generator**
  - Develop an algorithm that generates routines based on user goals and constraints.
- **Customization**
  - Allow users to customize generated routines by adding or removing exercises and adjusting the number of sets and repetitions.
- **User Interface**
  - Create an intuitive interface to display and manage routines. Display the number of sets, reps, and rest intervals.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**
  - Test the application to ensure its functionality and make necessary improvements.
- **Documentation**
  - Provide documentation for both users and developers to use and maintain the application.

### Risks and Risk Management Plan
| Explanation | Probability | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The time required to develop the software is underestimated | Moderate | Serious |
| 2 | Key staff unavailable at critical times | Moderate | Serious |
| 3 | The size of the software is underestimated | Moderate | Tolerable |
| 4 | Changes to requirements that require major design rework are proposed | Low | Tolerable |

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Minimization and Milestones:** In the first sprint, we will focus on implementing the minimal viable product (MVP). In each sprint, we will work towards well-defined objectives to mitigate feature/scope creep and enable the team to progress on schedule.

- **Contingency** : Acknowledging the unpredictability of illnesses and emergent situations, we aim to build redundancy into our team roles. Should a team member be unavailable, another team member will assume those responsibilities ensuring uninterrupted progress.

- **Avoidance** : Given the early stage of our product concept, we may adjust our overall goal during its development; however, we plan to maintain a well-defined product vision and implement and test our MVP early to avoid making significant modifications later in the development process.
